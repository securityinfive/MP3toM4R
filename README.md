# MP3toM4R
Convert MP3 files to M4R iOS Ringtone files. 

This is a python script to scan a folder and convert MP3 files to M4R files to be used as iPhone ringtones. 
I got tired of using online, untrusting, converters and figured out how to write one myself. 

NOTE - Ringtones needs to be 40 seconds or less. This script will auto trim if they are longer but I recommend using Audacity to edit MP3s if you want part of a song/movie quote. 

It's simple to use. 

Download/put your MP3s in a folder. 
Open your python windows or VSCode and navigate the terminal to the MP3 folder. 
Run the script. 
It will create a subfolder called ringtones.
The script will convert all found mp3s to m4r and save them in the ringtones folder. 

To get the M4R in your phone as a ringtone. Clunky but works without 3rd party software. 
Put the M4R files on a SSD drive, memory card, external storage. If you have latest iPhones, use USB-C cable and a card reader or connect the SSD directly to the phone and it will show up as an external drive in the Files app. 
OR you can use iCloud and save them into your Files directly. 
OR you can save them to OneDrive or other service.

The rest is done through GarageBand app. 

1 Save M4R to Files

2 Open GarageBand and tap the + icon

3 Scroll Audio Recorder and tap Voice

4 Tap the Tracks view icon (looks kind of like an I Ching hexagram) at top left

5 Tap the Loops icon (looks like a loop of string) at top right

6 Tap on the Files tab at top center then tap "Browse items from the Files app" - Select your external storage, OneDrive or wherever you stored the M4R files that the phone can access. 

7 Tap your M4R file.

8 Tap and start dragging the M4R filename, which will bring the Track view back up - drop the M4R at the top left corner

9 Tap the metronome icon to turn it off

10 Optional: Tap the + symbol at the top right corner, tap Section A, uncheck Automatic, and set length as desired

11 Tap the drop-down arrow at top left, then tap My Songs

12 Tap and hold the project you just created, tap Share, tap Ringtone, enter desired name, then tap Export.

13 When "Ringtone Export Successful" appears, you'll have the option to tap "Use sound as..." then select "Standard Ringtone", "Standard Text Tone", or "Assign to contact".


The ringtone will now be in your ringtones. To delte a ringtone, swipe left.
